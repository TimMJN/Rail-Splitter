# Rail-Splitter

This is a circuit for creating a buffered virtual ground. It is useful for powering synth modules from a DC power supply. For example, I use mine in combination with a lab PSU set to 24V. An isolated power supply is preferable, such that the virtual ground can be connected to the PSU's earth. 

I have provided a PCB layout, but as the circuit has only a few components, it can easily be build on perfboard or stripboard. I have attached some photos from my build, per inspiration.
