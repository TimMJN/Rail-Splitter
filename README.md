# Rail Splitter

This is a circuit for creating a buffered virtual ground. It is useful for powering synth modules from a DC power supply. For example, I use mine in combination with a lab PSU set to 24V. An isolated power supply is preferable, such that the virtual ground can be connected to the PSU's earth. Depending on the BUF634 package selected, this circuit may provide up to 150 or 250 mA. This is plenty for testing of one or a few modules. Obviously, powering a complete synth is better done by other means.

The circuit has only a few components, it can easily be build on perfboard or stripboard. I have attached some photos from my build, per inspiration.

I only ask to refrain from mass-production and commercialisation of PCBs/modules, as I rely on PCB sales for funding new module designs. If you use (parts of) my designs in your own modules, please credit me on your schematics and PCBs to help users find the original creator. I call upon your good conscience to make fair use of my work shared here.

# Support
If you like the resources I have made available here, and wish to support the development of new modules, feel free to buy me a few components through a small donation. I mainly design modules for fun, but you probably already know it can be a costly endeavour. All small contributions help me, thank you very much!
